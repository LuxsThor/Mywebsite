      <h3>My Work</h3>
      <p>Beeing detached from industry I got tired of learning things to simply pass standardized
      tests at university. I started making videos about things I had/wanted to learn anyway to
      produce some sort of output and as a self check if I actually understood the subject matter. </p>

      <h3>My Work</h3>
      <p> The internet and all the great learning recourses on it had a big influence on me.
        I wanted to have some skin in the online learning game and created a course on udemy.
        I had a terrible time talking into the camera but finished and shiped the course anyway.
        I am not promoting nor maintaing the course due to time constraints.
        Go check it out and have a laugh anyway ;).
